# Random N-numbers sum which is equal to 0

Write a function that as an argument gets the integer N `(1 < N < 100)`.

This function is to return an `array` that contains unique `N` random numbers in the range `-100` to `100`, and besides that the sum of these numbers must always go to `0`.

For example, for `N = 4` array `[-1, -2, 0, 3]`
