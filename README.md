## Description

> Sample coding challanges. You can write and test it right away.

A repository designed to store programming tasks. Due to the added tests, it is possible to control your own capabilities.

It's not perfect, so if you see a bug in the solution or within tests, it will be great if you share your thoughts on the subject, e.g. as an issue or creating a PR.

## How to work with it

First, you have to clone project

```
git clone https://github.com/403-html/javascript-coding-challenges.git
```

then install all dependencies

for npm

```
npm install
```

or yarn

```
yarn install
```

Then search for intresting challenge, for example `prime-number`.
Read the `README.md` in that folder. Write you solution in javascript file dedicated to this folder (in our case `isPrime.js`). There is special place dedicated for that.

If you're sure it's all good, go to `__tests__` folder and open test file. Remove `.skip` method in tests and save.

Run tests by npm

```
npm run prime-number
```

or if you're using yarn

```
yarn run prime-number
```

**If you take other task to do just use name of task folder instead of `prime-number`.**

**Enjoy!**
