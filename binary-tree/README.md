# Binary tree

You have to build a simple binary tree (there can only be a node of this tree in the console or you can plot it with HTML/CSS)

Basic principles:

-   left = smaller
    -   for each node
-   right = greater
    -   for each node
-   they must work for all integers
-   adding the possibility of adding new values to the tree
-   tree should have that properties
    -   each node should have properties
        -   "number"
        -   "nodeIndex"
        -   "left"
        -   "right"
    -   root node should have properties
        -   "valueIndex" (counting how many values were provided after "root" node get it's value)
