# Binary tree
You have to build simple binary-tree (can be in console just node of this tree or you can output it with graph in HTML/CSS)

Core rules:
- left lower numbers/right higher numbers rule have to work for all "rows"
- added option/automatic sorting numbers from lowest to highest (sorting by searching through tree, not by other sortings)
- have to wrok for all integer numbers
