# Binary tree
You have to build a simple binary tree (there can only be a node of this tree in the console or you can plot it with HTML/CSS)

Basic principles:
- left = smaller
  - for each node
- right = greater
  - for each node
- (optional) adding an option to automatically sort numbers from the lowest to the highest (sorting by searching the tree, not by other sorting)
- they must work for all integers
- adding the possibility of adding new values to the tree
