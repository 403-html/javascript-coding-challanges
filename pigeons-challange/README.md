# Pigeons
When I start to feed my pigeon, a minute later two more fly by. And a minute later another 3.
Then 4, and so on. One portion of food lasts a pigeon for a minute.
In case there’s not enough food for all the birds, the pigeons that came first, eat first. Pigeons are hungry animals and eat without stopping.
How many pigeons I’d have to feed at least once if I have N portions wheat?
