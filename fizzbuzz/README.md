# FizzBuzz array

FizzBuzz is the "Hello World" of technical interview questions. Your function should write the numbers from 1 to n with a twist; instead of any multiplier of 3, you output Fizz, instead of multiplers of 5 you output Buzz, and if they happen at the same time, you should use FizzBuzz. The output of your function should be a mixed array of numbers and strings.
